This is a collection of interesting articles, blog posts, editorials and other
pieces of content that I've personally found to be very worthwhile reads. Pull
requests are welcome, though forking your own repo likely makes more sense.

## Biography

* [Leonard Cohen Makes it
    Darker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/leonard-cohen-makes-it-darker)
    by David Remnick

    A very interesting read on the life and career of Leonard Cohen.

* [St. Leonard's
    Passion](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/music/89715/leonard)
    by Liel Liebovitz

    This shares some content with *Leonard Cohen Makes it Darker*, but it
    concentrates more on the story of Cohen's performance at the Isle of Wight
    in 1970. That performance--including his introductory remarks transcribed in
    the article--can be heard on Spotify
    [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/30juFhWr8RPtDT75soYnJb).

## Technology

* [The Night
    Watch](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/thenightwatch.pdf) by
    James Mickens

    This isn't life-changing by any means, but it's a very funny read about
    systems programming.

* [Putting a Finger on Our Phone
    Obsession](https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches) by Michael Winnick

    Some very interesting statistics on phone usage.

* [Being a Developer After
    40](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c#.ez548ytd9)
    by Adrian Kosmaczewski

    While I've a ways to go before I'm able to write a similarly titled article,
    I found this to be a very illuminating read. Mr. Kosmaczewski talks about
    the growth of his own career and shares some advice on what has helped him
    find success and satisfaction.

* [How Technology Hijacks People's
    Minds](https://medium.com/swlh/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3#.r3d5qvcto)
    by Tristan Harris

    Mr. Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, details several ways that a
    piece of software influences its users that are easy to miss. Personally, I
    think this should be required reading for anyone that develops software for
    non-personal use. It's also fascinating from the point of view of anyone
    that uses software (like you must be if you're reading this note).

* [Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single
    Repository](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext)
    by Rachel Potvin and Josh Levenberg

    An interesting read on the infrastructure used by Google to manage their
    code.

* [Why Your Next iPhone Won't be
    Ceramic](http://atomicdelights.com/blog/why-your-next-iphone-wont-be-ceramic)
    by Greg Koenig

    The title of this article implied to me that it would be an opinion piece
    about why Apple should or should not take a particular approach to the
    future of the iPhone. It ended up being a very interesting description about
    how the iPhone is (or might be) manufactured.

* [(Calculus) is at the Heart of the STEM Gender
    Gap](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/calculus-stem-gender-gap_us_57a1b9eee4b0e2e15eb7df83)
    by Dominique Mosbergen

    This article summarizes research that details at least one reason why women
    are underrepresented in STEM professions. It contains some very interesting
    information that I haven't seen elsewhere.

## Politics

* [Who are all these Trump
    supporters?](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/george-saunders-goes-to-trump-rallies)
    by George Saunders

    Regardless of your affiliation, there will always be other people at each
    and every other point along the political spectrum. Disagreement--even
    complete and total disagreement--is inevitable. In this article, Saunders
    attempts to form a bridge between the two major American political parties
    during the 2016 election. While I don't believe he's entirely successful, I
    felt that he came closer than most.

* [How Half of America Lost its F**cking
    Mind](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-trumps-rise-that-no-one-talks-about/)
    by David Wong

    A rather politically incorrect description of the divide between the voter
    base of each of the American political parties.

* [Why We're Living in the Age of
    Fear](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/why-were-living-in-the-age-of-fear-w443554)
    by Neil Strauss

    Even though we're living in what is essentially the statistically safest
    time in human history, we're presented with a lot of information that
    implies the opposite. This article details how our brains respond to that
    fear and how it can quickly change our opinions and values without our
    realization.

* [How to Listen When You
    Disagree](http://urbanconfessional.org/blog/howtodisagree) by Benjamin
    Mathes

    Hearing someone's opinions or beliefs is not the same as understanding them.
    Mr. Mathes details a story about an encounter with someone he disagreed with
    and how his first reaction was to defend his opinion without understanding
    hers. After hearing her reasoning, his opinion of the topic likely did not
    change, but he was able to gain a better understanding of his acquaintance's
    humanity, which I think is incredibly important.

## Other

* [If you’re 30% through your life, you’re likely 90% through your best
    relationships](http://qz.com/572284/the-tail-end/?utm_source=parVC) by Tim
    Urban

    This details a great number of ways to measure the passing of one's life. At
    first, it can be a bit disconcerting, but it gave me a great deal to reflect
    upon.

* [How to be mediocre and be happy with
    yourself](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37108240) by Manuela Saragosa

    There can be a lot of pressure to be exceptional. While I think that's a
    largely admirable goal, it's not feasible at scale. This is an interesting
    read that talks about both exceptionalism and mediocrity.

* [How Trees Calm
    Us](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-is-a-tree-worth) by Alex
    Hutchinson

    I'm always amazed by how much my mood improves when I'm working in a room
    with a window. This article details some of the ways that trees and other
    aspects of nature can impact us.

* [The Most Exclusive Restaurant in
    America](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/damon-baehrel-the-most-exclusive-restaurant-in-america?intcid=mod-most-popular)
    by Nick Paumgarten

    This article goes into a great amount of detail about a very peculiar
    restaurant in the woods of New York. Damon Baehrel, the name of both the
    chef/owner and the restaurant itself, claims to be almost entirely
    self-sufficient and incorporates such ingredients as pine needles and
    various saps, barks and fungi. It's a very interesting read largely because
    it describes a man and a restaurant that seem entirely unique (for better or
    for worse).

* [The Write Stuff: How the Humble Pencil Conquered the
    World](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a21567/history-of-the-pencil/)
    by Jonathan Schifman

    The history of things that I tend to take for granted always fascinates me.
    Mr. Schifman goes into a good amount of detail about the development and
    evolution of one of my favorite tools: the pencil.

* [Why It Doesn't Pay to be a
    People-Pleaser](http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_it_doesnt_pay_to_be_a_people_pleaser)
    by Christine Carter

    I feel that there's a lot of applicable wisdom in this article. In
    particular, recognizing the difference between pleasing and helping people
    has been very helpful to me.

* [I Followed My Stolen iPhone Across the World, Became a Celebrity in China and
    Found a Friend for
    Life](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/i-followed-my-stolen-iphone-across-the-world-became-a-celebr?utm_term=.yjyAkzOkz#.agDMqO3qO)

    I think the title does a great job of describing the content of this
    article. It's a very fascinating tale.

* [Why Red Means Red in Almost Every
    Language](http://nautil.us/issue/26/color/why-red-means-red-in-almost-every-language)
    by Chelsea Wald

    An interesting read on how linguistics, culture and perception are all
    interrelated.

* [Habits of Highly Mathematical
    People](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/habits-of-highly-mathematical-people-b719df12d15e#.nznvwv7cj)
    by Jeremy Kun

    A common question in math classrooms across the country is "When will I ever
    use this?" Mr. Kun describes several ways in which a mathematical education
    comes in handy in life (even if the specific problems encountered in the
    classroom don't seem entirely relevant).

* [The Downside of Being
    Happy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/25/why-happiness-might-be-getting-in-the-way-of-your-artistic-brilliance/)
    by Ana Swanson

    In many ways, it seems that a life full of eternal, unwavering happiness
    would be utopian. However, there are some advantages to experiencing the
    full range of human emotion.

* [The New Science of
    Cute](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/kumamon-the-new-science-of-cute)
    by Neil Steinberg

    Concentrating on Kumamon, the mascot of the Kumamoto province in Japan, this
    article talks about what we find cute and why.

* [I Got Arrested in Kazahkstan and Represented Myself in
    Court](https://medium.com/art-marketing/i-got-arrested-in-kazakhstan-and-represented-myself-in-court-d3764fb738f1#.od05gh27x)
    by Peretz Partensky

    I never expected a story about getting arrested in a country I know fairly
    little about to make me want to visit that country until I read this
    account.

* [Google’s former happiness guru developed a three-second brain exercise for
    finding joy](http://qz.com/818998/googles-former-happiness-guru-developed-a-three-second-brain-exercise-for-finding-joy/)
    by Lila MacLellan

    It can be easy to overwhelmed, but it can also be remarkably easy to find
    small moments of happiness.

* [Behind Our Anxiety, the Fear of Being
    Unneeded](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/dalai-lama-behind-our-anxiety-the-fear-of-being-unneeded.html?_r=0)
    by the Dalai Lama and Arthur C. Brooks

    The Dalai Lama writes about why he believes there is such discontent and
    unhappiness in a remarkably safe world.
